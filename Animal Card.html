                Bloodhounds are a hard working breed, utilized for their keen sense of smell. 
                They are a very strong willed breed, this can make obedience training quite difficult. 
                While priortized mainly as working dogs (especially for police and hunters), make fantastic family dogs due to their loving nature.  
                As an incredibly dependable breed, they can often be shown as lazy when uninterested.
